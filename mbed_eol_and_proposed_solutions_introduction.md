# Introduction

Mbed OS has been a prominent choice for embedded development on ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers, providing developers with a robust platform for building IoT and embedded applications. However, as with all technology, there comes a time when older systems must be phased out to make way for newer advancements. With the announcement of Mbed OS reaching its end-of-life (EOL), developers are now faced with the challenge of migrating their existing projects to alternative development environments.

The EOL of Mbed OS signifies the cessation of updates, security patches, and official support, which can pose significant risks to ongoing and future projects. Therefore, it is imperative for developers to transition to new platforms that offer continued support, advanced features, and a strong community.

This paper explores various open-source and best-of-class platforms that can serve as viable alternatives for migrating Mbed projects. The platforms discussed include:

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: A versatile, lightweight, and powerful code editor that supports a wide range of programming languages and development environments.
- **PlatformIO**: An open-source ecosystem for IoT development with a robust library of extensions and tools for embedded development.
- **Eclipse with GNU MCU Eclipse Plugins**: A popular integrated development environment (IDE) enhanced with plugins to support embedded systems programming.
- **STM32CubeIDE**: An IDE specifically designed for STM32 microcontrollers, providing comprehensive development tools and integration.
- **Keil MDK**: A professional development environment for ARM microcontrollers, known for its powerful debugging and optimization features.
- **IAR Embedded Workbench**: A high-performance development toolchain for embedded applications, offering advanced debugging and code analysis capabilities.
- **SEGGER Embedded Studio**: An IDE designed for embedded systems, providing a streamlined development experience with integrated tools and support for various microcontrollers.

Each of these platforms offers unique features and benefits, making them suitable candidates for migrating Mbed projects. This paper provides a detailed comparison of these platforms, examining their capabilities, ease of use, community and professional support, and overall suitability for embedded development. By evaluating these options, developers can make informed decisions about the best environment to continue their projects and ensure long-term success.
