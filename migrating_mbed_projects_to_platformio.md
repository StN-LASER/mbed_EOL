# Migrating Mbed Projects to PlatformIO

## Overview

Mbed OS is reaching its end-of-life (EOL), which may impact ongoing and future projects. This guide provides a detailed overview of how to migrate your Mbed projects to PlatformIO, a popular and actively maintained development environment for embedded systems.

## Benefits of Migrating to PlatformIO

1. **Ongoing Support**: PlatformIO is actively maintained, ensuring continuous updates, bug fixes, and new features.
2. **Multi-Framework Support**: PlatformIO supports multiple frameworks, providing flexibility for future projects.
3. **Integrated Environment**: PlatformIO offers an integrated development environment with powerful tools and features.
4. **Strong Community**: PlatformIO has a robust community, offering extensive resources and support.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration, ensure you have the following:

- **PlatformIO Installed**: Install PlatformIO in your preferred environment (VS Code, CLI, etc.).
- **Existing Mbed Project**: Ensure you have a working Mbed project to migrate.

## Migration Steps

### Step 1: Install PlatformIO

Install PlatformIO in your preferred development environment. For example, you can install PlatformIO as an extension in Visual Studio Code.

### Step 2: Initialize a PlatformIO Project

Navigate to your project directory and initialize a PlatformIO project. Replace `<your_board>` with the specific board you are using.

```sh
platformio init --board <your_board>
```

### Step 3: Move Project Files

Move your Mbed source files to the `src` directory and any libraries to the `lib` directory. Ensure your project structure aligns with PlatformIO's expectations:

```
your_project/
├── include
│   └── some_header.h
├── lib
│   └── some_library
│       └── some_library.cpp
├── src
│   └── main.cpp
└── platformio.ini
```

### Step 4: Configure `platformio.ini`

Create and configure the `platformio.ini` file. Below is an example configuration for an STM32 Nucleo board:

```ini name=platformio.ini
[env:nucleo_f401re]
platform = ststm32
board = nucleo_f401re
framework = mbed
build_flags = -DMBED_CONF_PLATFORM_STDIO_BAUD_RATE=115200
monitor_speed = 115200
```

### Step 5: Build and Upload

Use PlatformIO to build and upload your project:

```sh
platformio run
platformio run --target upload
```

## Common Migration Issues

### 1. Library Management

PlatformIO uses a different method for managing libraries compared to Mbed. You may need to adjust library paths or include statements. Ensure all necessary libraries are correctly configured in the `platformio.ini` file.

### 2. Configuration Differences

Some configuration settings in Mbed (`mbed_app.json`, `mbed_lib.json`) may need to be translated to PlatformIO's format (`platformio.ini`). Ensure all relevant configurations are correctly set.

### 3. Build System

PlatformIO uses a different build system, so certain build configurations in your Mbed project might need to be adjusted. Review and update build flags and settings as needed.

## Testing and Validation

Thoroughly test your migrated project to ensure all functionalities work as expected. Implement automated testing to catch any issues early. Validate performance and stability in the new environment.

## Conclusion

Migrating from Mbed OS to PlatformIO offers several benefits, including ongoing support and a robust development environment. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can successfully transition your projects to PlatformIO and continue development with confidence. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, the PlatformIO community and documentation are valuable resources.
